## Submission comment (2 sentences)
For this project, I created **BehavioTrack**, an AI-powered, privacy-first app for ABA therapists that automates behavior tracking and generates 4-for-4 session notes.
I used AI to produce four planning documents and then built and deployed a responsive landing page that demonstrates the app’s features and purpose.
